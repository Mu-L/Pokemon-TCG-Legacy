# The three MULTIPLIER TABLES stayed separate, and that is the point: a match, a gift reveal and a
# pack tear are authored at different tempos, so "medium" still means 1.25 for a match and 0.75 for
# a pack. One preset key, three ladders. Tune each table on its own.
#
# The old per-ladder "skip" presets are gone too. Skipping is now REDUCE MOTION — one switch that
# collapses all three at once, so the player cannot end up with a skipped pack opening and a slow
# match by accident. It is an accessibility control, not a fourth speed.

# ISSUE #253 - CLICK QUEUEING
# ============================================================
# REVERTED at the user's request (01/09/2026 retest 2). There WAS a global
# `_input` here that swallowed any mouse press arriving within 260ms of the last
# accepted one. It is gone, and deliberately not coming back.
#
# Why the whole idea was wrong: a time window can only ever say "that click came
# too soon", and the symptom the player actually sees - a button that keeps
# firing after they have stopped clicking - is a SLOW SCREEN, not a fast player.
# When a handler takes 300ms to redraw, every one of the player's clicks is
# hundreds of ms apart and every one of them is legitimate, so no window catches
# them; meanwhile the window is busy eating deliberate clicks on every fast
# screen in the game. It cost real input and bought nothing.
#
# The fix that does work is per-screen and is the opposite shape: a control that
# starts something is held DISABLED until the thing it started is on screen. See
# Pack_Purchase_Script._step_to_current_set for the worked example, and
# UIKit.hold_buttons() for the helper to do it on any other screen that shows the
# same symptom.
