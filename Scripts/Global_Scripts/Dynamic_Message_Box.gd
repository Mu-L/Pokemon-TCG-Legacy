# ============================================================
# DYNAMIC MESSAGE BOX
# ============================================================
# Every message box in the game - overworld dialogue, in-match messages, the
# outro's closing line and gift notices. Built entirely in code so it can
# resize, recolour and grow extra info chips at runtime.
#
# -- TWO VARIANTS, ONE COMPONENT ------------------------------
# set_system_variant() is the speaker flag. Everything else - insets, fill,
# radius, shadow, padding, the caret, the buttons - is shared.
#
#   CHARACTER (the default) - someone is speaking.
#       An 8px spine down the LEFT EDGE ONLY in the speaker's colour, a name
#       pill straddling the top edge with their portrait in it, the deck and
#       prize chips to its right, and a very faint outer glow in the same
#       colour. A full coloured border round a dark box reads as a warning
#       dialog, which is why the colour lives on one edge.
#
#   SYSTEM - the game is speaking. Every in-match message uses this.
#       No pill, no portrait, no chips, no spine. The theme gradient runs round
#       all four edges with a thicker hairline along the top, and the text is
#       centred and larger.
#
# Structure (bottom of a 1920x1080 reference screen):
#
#     [portrait NAME] [deck]DECK  [cup]6            [$ 1200]    <- pill row
#   +----------------------------------------------------------+
#   |  body text                                               |  <- 8px spine
#   |                    [ YES ]   [ NO ]                    v |
#   +----------------------------------------------------------+
#
# -- ADDING A NEW CHIP ----------------------------------------
# Nothing here is hardcoded to a chip count. Call set_chips() with as many
# entries as you like and the row lays itself out, auto-sizing each chip to its
# own icon + text and stepping the colour ramp one notch per chip:
#
#     box.set_chips([
#         { "text": "RAIN DANCE", "icon_path": ICON_DIR + "deck.png" },
#         { "text": "6",          "icon_path": ICON_DIR + "prizes.png" },
#     ])
#
# Each entry accepts:
#   "text"        String  - label drawn to the right of the icon (may be "")
#   "icon"        Texture2D - pre-loaded icon, wins over icon_path
#   "icon_path"   String  - res:// path, loaded on demand
#   "sprite"      String  - overworld sprite-sheet NAME; the idle-down frame is
#                           cropped to its opaque pixels and used as the icon
#
# THE NAME IS NOT A CHIP any more. set_name_pill() owns it - it carries the
# portrait and the speaker's own colour, and the chips step the ramp from index
# 1 so their colouring is exactly what it always was.

# ============================================================
# DIALOGUE TOKENS
# ============================================================
# Authored dialogue may carry tokens that only resolve at the moment the line is
# shown. They are substituted HERE, in the one funnel every message in the game
# passes through, so no caller and no map script has to know they exist:
#
#     "Good [TIME]! How's it going [NAME]?"  ->  "Good Morning! How's it going Olly?"
#
# Write them in the `says` blocks of NPC_and_Opponent_Data/Characters/*.json.
#
#   [TIME]  the time of day, capitalised   -> Morning / Afternoon / Evening / Night
#   [time]  the same, lowercase, for mid-sentence use ("see you in the [time]")
#   [NAME]  the player's trainer name
#
# TWO RULES THIS MUST KEEP:
#
#   1. Substitute BEFORE the RichTextLabel sees the string. A token is
#      syntactically a bbcode tag, so anything left unresolved is swallowed by
#      the parser and takes the rest of the line with it.
#   2. An UNKNOWN token is left exactly as written. A typo must show up as a
#      visible "[TIEM]" in game, never as a blanked-out line of dialogue.
#
# Adding a token is one entry in _resolve_tokens(). Keep the list short - every
# token is another thing the writer has to remember.
