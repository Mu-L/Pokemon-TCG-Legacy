# ============================================================
# UIKit — the reusable UI components, skinned from UITheme
# ============================================================
# Static helpers on a RefCounted, the same shape as ShopChrome, which this sits
# alongside. Every screen is assembled from these; none of them should be
# hand-rolled a second time in a screen script.
#
#   Chrome      add_field() · add_header() · add_footer()
#   Content     make_panel() · make_chip() · make_slot() · make_meter()
#               make_damage_counters()
#   Feedback    add_selection_ring() · pulse()
#   Text        style_label() · set_label() · style_button()
#
# ── THE THREE THINGS CARRYING THE THEME ──────────────────────
# The gradient bars, the darkened field, and the chevrons scrolling across both
# in opposite directions. add_field() and add_header()/add_footer() are what
# put those on a screen; a screen that skips them will not look like the rest
# of the game however well it uses the rest of this file.
#
# ── REDUCED MOTION ───────────────────────────────────────────
# Every animated component asks UITheme.motion_reduced() at build time and
# re-checks it when the theme changes. Motion stops; nothing disappears. A
# frozen chevron field still reads as the design, an absent one does not.

# ISSUE #197: EVERY NUMBER HERE IS A FRACTION OF THE ITEM, NOT A PIXEL COUNT.
# The first version dropped every shadow by a flat (11, 14) px. That is a couple
# of percent on a 430px booster pack — which is why the pack shop was the one
# screen that looked right — and better than a tenth of a 100px coin or a 90px
# sleeve, where it read as a second object lying beside the first. Anchor
# fractions also mean the shadow never has to know the item's size, which is not
# settled on the frame a container child is added.
#
# ISSUE #197 (retest 2): SAME SIZE as the item, offset RIGHT and DOWN. The
# same-size half stands - a shadow bigger than its caster reads as a second copy
# peeking out on every side at once, where an identically sized one displaced
# further reads as one object lifted off the page. Only the direction changed
# back: the light is above and to the left, so the shadow falls right and down.
const SHADOW_GROW  := 0.0                     # same size as the item
# ISSUE #197 (retest 4): ONE NUMBER, AND THE SAME NUMBER OF PIXELS IN BOTH
# DIRECTIONS. The light is above and to the left, so the shadow falls right and
# down, and it has to be EQUALLY visible right and down or it stops reading as a
# lift off the page.
#
# The old pair (0.030 right, 0.042 down) could not do that, because an anchor
# fraction is a fraction of that AXIS: on a square coin 3% and 4.2% are near
# enough the same few pixels — which is why the coins always looked right — but
# on a 300x430 pack they are 9px right against 18px down. Retest 3's
# SHADOW_DROP_TALL then pushed the x further out and made y NEGATIVE, which is
# the shadow the user saw poking out of the TOP of the pack. Both are gone.
#
# SHADOW_DROP is now a single fraction of the item's WIDTH, and the vertical
# anchor is scaled by the item's aspect at build time so it comes out as the same
# pixel count. See add_drop_shadow.

# the material tracks the node's actual size, which nothing does for free.
#
# It also owns the reduced-motion switch: `base_speed` is the authored scroll
# rate and `scroll_speed` on the material is either that or zero. Keeping the
# authored value here means turning motion back on does not need to know what
# the speed was.

	# run it again — the alternative was every screen rebuilding its chrome, and
	# the map sits behind the Options overlay without ever being rebuilt.

	# too — either one would empty the bar instead of un-painting it.
	#
	# `self_modulate` affects only the node's OWN drawing. The gradient and its
	# light bands disappear; every child keeps drawing in exactly the same place,
	# at the same size, in the same colour. The bar also keeps its height, so no
	# content anywhere on the screen moves. That is the whole of the feature: the
	# contents appear to float over the field.
	#
	# Do not "improve" this by hiding the node, collapsing the container,
	# reparenting the title into the field, or restyling anything for the
	# no-banner case. Hiding the paint is all it does.
