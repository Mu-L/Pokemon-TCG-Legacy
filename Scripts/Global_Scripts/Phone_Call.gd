# ============================================================
# PHONE CALL — the video-call cutscene
# ============================================================
# A phone rises from the bottom of the screen, connects, and somebody talks to the player through
# it. Three swappable pieces and nothing else:
#
#   PHONE        the handset art. Expected to stay the same, but it is a config field so a
#                character can call from a different model later.
#   TALKING HEAD the caller. One base sprite plus its numbered frames (`_2`, `_3`, ...), which are
#                discovered automatically — the mouth animation is built from however many exist.
#                Swapping a costume is swapping this one name.
#   BACKGROUND   whatever is behind them. Also one name.
#
# Every call is a Dictionary (or an entry in Phone_Calls.json), so a new call is data, not code:
#
#     var call := PhoneCall.play_from_data(self, "ellie_intro")
#     await call.finished
#
# ── THE SCREEN IS A HOLE IN THE PHONE ────────────────────────
# The phone art has a TRANSPARENT rectangle where its screen is, and the caller and background are
# drawn BEHIND it through that hole. The hole is FOUND, not hardcoded: _find_screen_rect() scans the
# phone texture for the transparent region inside its opaque body. That is what makes a new phone
# sprite a drop-in — no measuring, no per-phone constants. A phone whose screen is not transparent
# can still say so with a "screen_rect" field in its config.
#
# Layering, back to front: background, caller, phone, the connecting cover (inside the screen only),
# and the message box over everything.
#
# ── THE MOUTH ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The frames cycle 1-2-3-2-1-2-3-2... (a ping-pong, so the loop never jumps) and ONLY while the
# message box is actually typing letters. The moment the text stops appearing the caller drops back
# to frame 1 with their mouth shut. That is why this reads as speech rather than as an idle loop —
# see DynamicMessageBox.is_typing(), which is the single thing driving it.
#
# ── AUTO-ADVANCING CALLS ─────────────────────────────────────
# `auto_advance` is for a call that plays over a cutscene the player is not driving — the taxi
# intro. Lines advance on a timer and clicks are swallowed. Every other call is a normal message
# box: click or Space to advance, and the first press finishes the line being typed.

# of what reads as "thrown on screen"; shortening the time alone just looks rushed.
#
# The overshoot is an explicit PIXEL figure rather than Tween.TRANS_BACK, whose overshoot is a

# not eat into the reading time. Per-character, clamped at both ends.
#
# PER_CHAR is the reading rate: 0.036 is about 28 characters a second, brisk but comfortable for
# conversational dialogue. THE CAP IS THE FIGURE THAT MATTERS for a call with long lines - at the
