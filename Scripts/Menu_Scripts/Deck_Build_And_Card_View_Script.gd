# ─── DEBUG-ONLY DECK RULES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# While debug mode is on (DebugMode.is_enabled(), see Debug_Mode.gd) the deck
# builder drops the "exactly 60 cards" and "max 4 per name group" (and per-card
# ownership) save restrictions, so any deck can hold any number of any card —
# invaluable for building a one-card test deck to exercise a single attack.
# In a release build the normal rules always apply.
#
# This used to be a hardcoded `const TESTING_UNLIMITED_DECKS := true`, which
# meant a shipped build had no deck rules at all. The two places that read it
# now call DebugMode.is_enabled() directly: _get_max_for_card() and
# _deck_save_blocker().

# ─── Energy style data ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# lightning, psychic, fighting.  The order matters because each set has
