extends Control

# ============================================================
# OPTIONS
# ============================================================
# Eleven rows, each a label on the left and its control group on the right.
# Everything fits between the bars with nothing to scroll — see _build_rows().
#
# ── BUILT IN CODE, NOT IN THE SCENE ──────────────────────────
# This screen used to be ~55 hand-placed nodes at absolute offsets, and every
# time a row was added the WHOLE page had to be re-spaced by hand — adding the
# volume sliders moved every `offset_top` on the screen and squeezed the
# inter-section gaps from 19/28px down to 12/18px to make room.
#
# It is a VBoxContainer now. Adding a row is one entry in _build_rows() and one
# entry in each of the three dictionaries; nothing else moves, and nothing has
# to be measured. Options_Scene.tscn is a bare Control carrying this script.
#
# ── THE THREE DICTIONARIES ───────────────────────────────────
# Every row, slider included, flows through the same pending/saved model:
#
#   section_buttons  section name -> { option value : Button }
#   section_sliders  section name -> { "slider": HSlider, "value_label": Label }
#   section_setters  section name -> the GameState call that persists it
#
# `pending` is what the player has clicked, `saved` is what is on disk. Save
# walks the difference. A new row needs an entry in all three plus one in
# _current_values() and nothing else.
#
# THE TWO THEME ROWS ARE THE EXCEPTION. "Colour theme" and "Mode" are two rows
# on screen but one stored value: both read and write `pending["ui_theme"]`,
# recomposing `<look>_<mode>`. They have no section_setters entry of their own
# and they never appear in `pending`. See THEME_LOOK / THEME_MODE.
#
# ── THE ROWS THAT PREVIEW THEMSELVES ─────────────────────────
# Five rows apply the moment you touch them, because their effect is visible on
# THIS screen and waiting for Save would mean choosing blind:
#
#   the two volume sliders   you hear it
#   reduce motion            the chevrons stop
#   colour theme / mode      every colour on the page changes
#   hide header/footer       the banners go
#
# All five follow the same contract: applied live, written to disk only by Save,
# and put back by Cancel and Escape (_revert_live_changes). Live and saved are
# separate things — dragging a slider or previewing a theme never touches the
# save file. Every other row does nothing until Save.
#
# The three colour rows rebuild the whole screen when touched, because every
# colour was read at build time and the button faces are baked art. See
# _rebuild().
# Values are held here as whole percents 0-100 so change detection stays an
# exact integer comparison; GameState stores 0.0-1.0.
#
# ── WHAT CHANGED IN THE UI OVERHAUL ──────────────────────────
# The three animation-speed rows (match / item reveal / pack opening) became
# ONE "Animation speed" row at slow / medium / fast. Their three multiplier
# tables still exist and still differ — see GameState.
#
# The per-ladder "skip" presets became "Reduce motion", which collapses all
# three at once AND stops the chevron scroll and the selection-ring spin.
#
# "Match intro & outro" stays its own row. It is not the same control as reduce
# motion: this one removes the screen, reduce motion keeps the screen and
# collapses its movement.
#
# Message box colour is not here and should not come back: each NPC and
# opponent carries its own `message_colour` and the box is themed per speaker.
# ============================================================

# ─── Layout ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# TWEAKABLE. All in px at 1920x1080; the block is centred in whatever height is
# left between the header and the footer.
# Widened from 1330 so the eight theme buttons fit on ONE line. That single

# The row labels keep small_label's mono caps — it reads as a form label rather
# than a heading — but at a larger size than the role's own 13.5, which left the
# screen looking sparse against eight widely spaced rows.
