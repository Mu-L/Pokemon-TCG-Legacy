## remainder, and it is computed rather than guessed. That is the honest cost of
## the alignment the redesign asks for: at 504 tall the sprite alone was most of a
## 564px box, so it comes down to ~389.
##
## Only the BOX has a shape of its own - _apply_fit_size letterboxes the real art
## inside it and keeps the art's aspect, which is what #200 was logged for.

## ISSUE #200 (retest 4): +25%, AND IT IS THE *WIDTH* THAT DELIVERS IT.
##
## Nearly every in-battle sprite on disk is SQUARE (160x160, 180x180, 928x928 -
## 250 of the 258 files). Fitted into the 298x389 portrait box the previous pass
## derived, a square sprite letterboxes on WIDTH and renders 298x298, leaving
## ~91px of dead space underneath it. So making the BOX taller would have changed
## nothing on screen at all, and the box could not get taller anyway without
## breaking the alignment with the Matches won panel that the same row asked for.
##
## 298 * 1.25 = 372. That fits the panel's 414px of inner width (450 - 2*18), and
## it is still under SPRITE_FIT_H, so the +25% costs the top box nothing and its
## bottom edge stays exactly level with Matches won.
##
## The name field and the dates need no numbers of their own: _build_left_panel
## measures them from the BOTTOM OF THE ART, so they move down 74px by themselves.
