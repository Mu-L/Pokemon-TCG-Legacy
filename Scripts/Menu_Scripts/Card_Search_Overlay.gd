class_name CardSearchOverlay
extends Control

# Full-screen card search / filter screen for the deck builder.
#
# Built entirely in code (like the energy style picker) and parented under the deck build Control,
# so it renders above the right-hand banner but inside the same scene. The deck builder hides its
# own UI while this is up, then does the actual filtering itself — this screen only collects the
# player's choices and hands them back as a criteria Dictionary.
#
# Usage:
#   var overlay := CardSearchOverlay.new()
#   add_child(overlay)
#   overlay.setup(unlocked_set_ids, set_list)
#   overlay.search_confirmed.connect(_on_search_confirmed)
#   overlay.search_cancelled.connect(_on_search_cancelled)
#
# Filter semantics (decided with the player):
#   - OR *within* a category, AND *between* categories.
#   - The name box is always an AND, matched as a case-insensitive substring.
#   - Pokemon-only rows (type / stage / Pokemon sub type) and the Trainer-only row (trainer sub
#     type) auto-select their implied Card Type and lock out the opposite supertype. It also works
#     the other way now: picking a Card Type greys out the rows that supertype can never have.
#     See _apply_lock.

signal search_confirmed(criteria: Dictionary)
signal search_cancelled()
## RESET was pressed. The screen has already blanked its own selections; the listener is expected to
## drop any search currently applied to the grid behind, so the two can't disagree.

# LAYOUT, rebuilt 2026-08-24 for ISSUES #142 / #145 / #146 / #147. Read this before tuning
# anything below it.
#
# #141 hides the deck screen's ~300px right-hand card banner while this screen is up, so the
# rows own the FULL 1920 rather than stopping short of it (#142). Every row is laid out
# left-aligned from CTRL_X; icon rows spread across CTRL_W via _row_pitch(), button rows step by a
# fixed BTN_W + BTN_GAP.
#
# RETEST PASS 2026-08-24 (#145 / #146 follow-ups). Two icon rows are sized by HEIGHT now, not by a
# square cell: icon_power/icon_body are ~4.15:1 strips, so drawing them KEEP_ASPECT_CENTERED in a
# 124x124 box rendered them 124x30 with ~47px of dead air above AND below — "almost an entire row
# of space". _make_icon_h() fixes the rendered HEIGHT and derives the width from the art's aspect,
# so the row box is exactly as tall as what is drawn in it. The same helper gives the POKEMON SUB
# TYPE row a uniform icon height (the four glyphs range from 0.96:1 to 1.42:1, so in a square cell
# they came out visibly different heights). Reclaiming the power row's dead 94px is what let
# ROW_GAP go back up from 8 to 16.
#
# #146 then shrank almost everything to buy back the vertical space #147's five set rows need:
#   name / illustrator boxes   -25% (height and font)
#   card type / stage / trainer sub / sort buttons  -25% (height and font; the width was later
#                              unified at BTN_W = 250 for all four rows, see #146's retest)
#   pokemon type icons         -10%
#   set icons                  -10%
#   pokemon sub type icons     -10%
#   rarity icons               -40%
# ...against #145, which DOUBLED the Has Power / Has Body icons. With every set unlocked the rows
# finish at y = 984 against a FOOTER_TOP of 996, so there is about 12px of slack and no more.
#
# CONSEQUENCE WORTH KNOWING: the ~180px of headroom that used to be reserved for the EFFECT row
# (see EFFECT_FILTERS) is gone. Populating that row now needs vertical space found elsewhere. The
# SET block is far and away the biggest thing on the screen at 269px with all five generation
# lines showing, so an EFFECT row most likely means shrinking SET_ICON or reclaiming ROW_GAP.

# Card type lock
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# Rows that can only ever describe a Pokemon, and rows that can only ever describe a Trainer.
# Selecting anything in either group locks the Card Type row to that supertype and blocks the
# opposite group, because the combination could never match a card.
#
# CHANGED 2026-08-24 — this now works in BOTH directions. It used to be deliberately one-way (a sub
# type implied a card type, but never the reverse), which left "Trainer" selectable alongside a live
# POKEMON SUB TYPE row: a combination that can match nothing, offered as though it were valid.
# Picking a Card Type by hand now greys out the rows that supertype can never have — Trainer or
# Energy greys the three Pokemon-only rows, Pokemon or Energy greys TRAINER SUB TYPE.
#
# The two directions stay distinct in the UI, and the difference is deliberate:
#   * a FORCED card type (implied by a sub-row) goes green-and-DISABLED — the player cannot undo it
#     without first clearing the row that implied it;
#   * a HAND-PICKED card type stays green and clickable, so it can always be toggled back off. Only
#     the rows it excludes go grey.
# Selecting BOTH Pokemon and Trainer blocks nothing: OR-within-a-category means a card may be either.
#
# Still NOT part of the lock, on purpose: RARITY (a whole-card property) and HAS POWER OR BODY
# (eight Trainers carry a real Poke-Body, so forcing Pokemon there would hide real matches).

## ISSUE #149: splits one free-text box into OR terms on a COMMA.
##
## The separator was " OR " originally, which needed a pile of failsafes: "or" is a substring of
## real card names (Voltorb, Porygon, Electrode), so the parser had to distinguish a separator from
## a search term and had to define what a box holding nothing but separators meant. A comma has
## none of that ambiguity — **not one of the ~2,000 cards in any of the 37 sets has a comma in its
## name** — so a comma is only ever a separator and every one of those failsafes is gone with it.
##
## Returns a plain Array of lower-cased, non-empty terms. The caller ORs them together and ANDs the
## result with every other filter, exactly as a single substring used to behave. An empty array
## means no filter on this box, which now also covers the degenerate ",,," case: nothing to search
## for, so nothing is excluded.
##
## Spacing around the comma is free — terms are stripped — so "Dratini,Dragonite" and
## "Dratini, Dragonite" are the same search, and a trailing "Dratini," just drops the empty tail.
##
## ONE KNOWN WRINKLE, in the illustrator box only: 24 cards in neo1-neo4 carry a collaborator
## credit of the form "K. Hoshiba, CR CG gangs", so their artist string does contain a comma.
## Searching "Hoshiba" or "CR CG gangs" still works (each is one term, matched as a substring);
## only pasting the full comma-containing string verbatim widens the search, and even then the
## result is a superset of what was wanted. Card names are unaffected.
