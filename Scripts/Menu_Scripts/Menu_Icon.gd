# ============================================================
# MENU ICON — the main menu's icons, drawn rather than imported
# ============================================================
# Eight icons, every one drawn from primitives in _draw(). They replace eight
# PNGs of screenshotted game art (a real trainer card, real coin renders, real
# sleeve photos) which could not take a colour from the theme and sat at
# whatever resolution they happened to be.
#
# ── WHY DRAWN, NOT BAKED ─────────────────────────────────────
# These are the only art on the menu that has to RECOLOUR. Each tile carries its
# own hue and its own computed label colour, so the icon on it must be that
# colour too — and that colour is not known until the theme is read. A drawn
# icon takes `ink` as a parameter and is correct on every tile of every theme;
# a baked one would need 8 icons x 8 looks of pre-tinted PNGs.
#
# They also stay sharp at any size, which matters because the hero tile's icon
# is ~340px and the footer's are 78px.
#
# ── HOW TO DRAW ONE ──────────────────────────────────────────
# Every icon is authored in a 0..1 UNIT SQUARE and scaled to fit whatever rect
# the node is given, centred on the short axis. `_u(x, y)` maps a unit point into
# local pixels and `_s(n)` scales a unit length. Nothing in here should contain a
# raw pixel number — that is what keeps one icon legible at 78px and at 340px.
#
# Keep them simple. At a glance, on a saturated tile, a silhouette reads and a
# detailed illustration does not.
# ============================================================

	var centre := _u(0.5, 0.54)
	var r := _s(0.30)
	var w := _s(0.115)

	draw_arc(centre, r, -PI * 0.35, PI * 1.35, 48, ink, w, true)
	_round_rect(_u(0.5, 0.30), Vector2(_s(0.055), _s(0.155)), _s(0.055), ink)
