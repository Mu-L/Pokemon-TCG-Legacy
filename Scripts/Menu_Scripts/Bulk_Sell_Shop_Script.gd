# ============================================================
# CARD BUYER — BULK SELL SHOP
# ============================================================
# The Gym Plaza Card Buyer's full screen. Buys every copy of a card the player owns
# BEYOND the fourth, which is the most any legal deck can hold — so nothing sellable
# here can ever be a card the player still needs.
#
# TWO SCREENS in one Control, toggled by _show_home() / _show_list():
#
#   HOME  — three fanned card groups (commons / uncommons / rares), the per-card price
#           under each, a button per rarity plus a "sell all", and the player's cash.
#           Chrome is the standard shop look: horizontal top and bottom borders over a
#           scrolling background.
#
#   LIST  — every spare copy the chosen button covers, laid out exactly as the deck
#           builder's "view deck" screen lays out a deck: same 9-column grid, same card
#           size, same right-hand INDIVIDUAL / CATEGORIES bar, same top-and-right border
#           chrome. The ordering and the bar both come from CardViewerList, which the
#           deck viewer also uses, so the two screens cannot drift apart.
#
# THE ECONOMY, for context (the user's figures): a base1 pack costs $150 and contains
# 6 commons + 3 uncommons + 1 rare, which sells back for 6*5 + 3*10 + 25 = $85. Even a
# pack that rolls its 25% bonus rare only returns $110. Selling bulk is always a loss
# against buying packs, which is the point — it is a way to turn dead duplicates into
# some cash, not an income source.

## 211..566 once the outer cards' rotation is counted, labels at 600, buttons ending at
## 870 — centred on y 541. The content band it is centred against used to end at the money

## Adapted from Pack_Opening_Manager._show_bonus_label.
## ISSUE #208: where the payout figure starts — directly under the wallet pill,
## touching neither it nor the header border.
##

## the pill's centre x so the figure falls straight out of the number it changes,
## and far enough down that the box's top edge clears the pill's bottom.
## ISSUE #208 (retest 3) - WHY THREE NUDGES CHANGED NOTHING.
##
## `wallet_chip` is the HOLDER add_wallet_chip returns, and that holder is never
## given a size: the pill is a child placed at absolute coordinates inside it, so
## the holder's rect is (0,0) 0x0. `wallet_chip.get_global_rect().size.x` was
## therefore always 0, the guard below always tripped, and the function returned
## the HARDCODED fallback every single time. The "measured off the wallet chip"
## description was never true in a running build, which is why the label sat in
## the same place through 1560 -> 1750 -> 1760 -> 1780. ShopChrome.wallet_pill_rect
