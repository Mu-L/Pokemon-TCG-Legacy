# ============================================================
# SHARED CARD-COLLECTION VIEWER (extracted from Deck_Build_And_Card_View_Script.gd)
# ============================================================
# Everything the "view deck" screen uses to turn a {card_id: count} dictionary into
#   1. a display ORDER for the card grid, and
#   2. the right-hand INDIVIDUAL / CATEGORIES text list beside it.
#
# It lives here rather than in the deck builder because the Card Buyer's bulk-sell
# screen shows the exact same thing for a different set of cards, and the two must
# never drift apart. Nothing in here reads deck state or touches the tree beyond the
# parent it is handed.
#
# CARD METADATA is NOT owned here. Every entry point takes a `meta_fn` Callable of the
# shape `func(card_id: String) -> Variant` returning the card's metadata dictionary
# (name / supertype / subtypes / types / evolvesFrom / rarity) or null. The deck
# builder passes its own cache, which carries extra fields the search screen needs;
# the sell screen passes a smaller one. Neither has to know about the other.

# ─── Right-hand card list (ISSUE #152) ───────────────────────────────────────
# TWEAKABLE. A text list of the viewer's unique cards down the right-hand bar — the strip beside the
# card grid that is otherwise empty. One line per card: "<name> (xN)".
#
# GEOMETRY: the bar runs from the right edge of the viewer's card grid (x 1681) to the screen edge,
# and the list starts level with the top of the grid rather than at the top of the screen. It stops
# above the button(s) beneath it; callers that need more room at the bottom (the bulk-sell screen has
# two buttons stacked there, not one) pass their own `bottom`.
#
# FONT SIZING — read this before changing the width or putting the card id back. The bar is only
# ~226px wide, which is the whole constraint. Lines are "<name> (xN)" and nothing else: dropping the
# id was worth a lot here, because "ecard1-148 Professor Elm's Training Method (x4)" needed ~34px of
# width per point of font (font 6 to fit on one line, i.e. unreadable) while the name alone needs
# ~26px. Measured across all 1,308 distinct card names: 99.3% fit on one line at font 10 and 97.8%
# at font 11, and the 13-line starter deck comes out at font 15.
# The list still copes with the rest by:
#   1. picking the largest font in [MIN, MAX] at which THIS list's longest line and its line count
#      both fit — so a short list gets big text and a long one shrinks to suit,
#   2. word-wrapping anything still too long rather than clipping it (only ~9 of 1,308 names are
#      long enough to wrap at font 10),
#   3. sitting in a ScrollContainer, so even 60 unique long-named cards remain reachable.
# Widening the bar would need the card grid narrowed to 8 columns; that is a deliberate trade the
# user has not asked for.
const VIEWER_LIST_X          := 1689.0
const VIEWER_LIST_W          := 226.0
const VIEWER_LIST_TOP        := 110.0    # level with the card grid, just under the top border
const VIEWER_LIST_BOTTOM     := 990.0    # clear of the Close button at y 1003
const VIEWER_LIST_PAD        := 6.0      # breathing room so text never touches the scrollbar
# MEASURED, not guessed: the list label sits directly in the ScrollContainer with no
# margin container, so the only thing between VIEWER_LIST_W and the text is the
# vertical scrollbar. Built the real node arrangement headless to check — the label
# comes back 218px wide inside a 226px scroller, and the RichTextLabel's own
# stylebox contributes no margin at all.
const VIEWER_LIST_SCROLLBAR  := 8.0

# ── Type sizing ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The individual list runs at roughly DOUBLE the old 10-18, and the fit rule
# changed with it. It used to demand that a WHOLE LINE fit the bar's width, which
# is what held the text down to 10-15pt. Wrapping is now accepted, so the only
# hard requirement is that the longest WORD fits — a wrapped name is fine, a word
# running off the bar is not.
#
# Measured over all 1,308 distinct card names: the longest single word in the
# game is "Counterattack" (Counterattack Claws) at 217px for a 214px bar, so it
# alone needs 19pt. It is one name in 1,308 and the fit is per-LIST, so only a
# list actually holding that card is affected — and AUTOWRAP_WORD_SMART breaks an
# over-long word rather than letting it overflow, so even that case is safe at
# the minimum. At 24pt, 1,303 of 1,308 names fit unbroken; at 20pt, 1,307.
#
# The HEIGHT is deliberately not part of the fit any more. Keeping it would drag
# a 20-unique-card deck straight back to the minimum and undo the whole change;
# the list sits in a ScrollContainer, so length costs a scroll rather than
# legibility.

# otherwise have to be broken mid-word.

# two separate facts — so these fit on whole-line width. The MAX matches the list's

# "Sp. Energy  60", measures 189px at 20 and still fits.

# Header CEILING, not the header size — the header is fitted down from
# (list size + this) until it fits the bar. It used to be applied blind, which is
# what let "CATEGORIES" wrap to "CATEGORI / ES": the list could reach 32, taking the
# header to 34 and the word to ~265px in a 212px bar. "CATEGORIES" is the wider of
# the two headers despite being the same length as "INDIVIDUAL" (188px vs 164px at
# 24), so it is the one that decides the size.
#
# It is 4 rather than 2 because the headers are pinned at 24 while the body text
# came down to 20 — the gap absorbed the body's last reduction. If the body size
# changes again and the headers should follow it rather than stay put, this is the
