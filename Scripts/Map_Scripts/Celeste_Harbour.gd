# The intro phone call. Ellie rings while the taxi is still driving in, so the two play together and
# the drive-by is what she is talking about ("I'll see you drive right on by in a sec").
#
# It is an ORDINARY call - the player clicks through her lines at their own pace - so the cutscene
# cannot assume any particular length for it. It waits once, on the doorstep; see the doorstep wait
# in _run_taxi_intro().
#
# TWEAKABLE. The delay is measured from the first frame of the cutscene: long enough for the 3s fade
# from black to be well under way, early enough that the whole call lands before the taxi stops. The
# call is roughly 17.5s at the default text speed and the drive is 20s, so there is room either way -
# and if a slow text speed overruns it, _run_taxi_intro() waits for it rather than talking over the
# player's first steps. See Phone_Call.gd for the call itself and Phone_Calls.json for the script.

#   DRIVE_TIME  the long constant-speed run in. Raising it slows the taxi down; the distance is
#               fixed, so time and speed are the same dial.
#   STOP_TIME   the deceleration to a halt.
#   DRIVE_SPEED_MATCH keeps the two joined smoothly: it is the fraction of the way along at which
#               phase one hands over, chosen so the EASE_OUT of phase two BEGINS at exactly phase
#               one's speed. It falls out of the two times as f / DRIVE_TIME = 2(1 - f) / STOP_TIME,
#               so scaling BOTH times together (as the 10% slow-down did) leaves it correct - but
