# ============================================================
# ACTION PANEL (UI overhaul, stage 7)
# ============================================================
# Attacks, Poke-Powers and Retreat live ON the Pokemon now, as a column of rows
# in the info panel beside each active. The footer's ATTACK / POWER / RETREAT
# buttons are gone; only End Turn is left.
#
# Row order, top to bottom:
#   Poke-Power   accent_2 border, transparent fill. Only if the card has one.
#   Attack       cost pips, name, damage. One row each.
#   Retreat      DASHED border, so it never reads as a fourth attack.
#
# WHY RETREAT BELONGS HERE: it costs energy, it is paid by the active Pokemon,
# and it competes with attacking for the same turn. Putting it in the panel makes
# that competition visible and gives it somewhere to show its cost as pips, which
# a footer button never could.
#
# THE OPPONENT GETS THE SAME PANEL, always dimmed and never interactive. It is
# there so you can read the threat before committing your turn.
#
# ── THE LIST HAS NO UPPER BOUND ──────────────────────────────
# A card's attacks are not the attacks it was printed with: every Technical
# Machine adds or replaces one, Meteor Falls and gym1 Recall add the whole
# pre-evolution chain, and ex12 Versatile adds the attacks of every Pokemon in
# play. Past ACTION_MAX_ROWS the column becomes a ScrollContainer rather than
# growing into the bench.

## ISSUE #160: HOW FAR APART THE CARDS IN AN ATTACHMENT PEEK-STACK SIT.
##
## The stack used to step a flat 80px per card and only compress past SIX, and
## even then to a 480px target. Both actives sit in a 96px attachment column near
## the edge of the board, so the FIFTH energy was already ~320px out — off the
## left of the screen for the player and off the right for the opponent. That is
## what "the game never seems to be aware of a 5th energy" actually was: the
## energy was attached and counted, it just could not be seen.
##
## The whole stack is now held inside ATTACH_STACK_SPAN however many cards are on
## it, so the fan gets tighter rather than longer. TWEAKABLE.
## 160, not 210: the attachment column is only DUEL_COL_ATTACH (96) wide and the
## player's stack fans LEFT from it, so anything wider walks into the left rail.
## ISSUE #216 (retest): 160 -> 300. The stacks fan OUTWARD from the attachment
## column into the band between the duel row and the rail, and at the duel row's
## y (326..645) that band is completely empty - the rail's own occupants sit at
## y 132..239 and y 690..767. 160px was throwing away roughly twice as much free
## space as it was using, which is exactly what the retest said.

## Pokemon (which several effects did) repainted the active's HP with the bench
## Pokemon's numbers, so the active appeared to jump to 40/50 while the Pokemon
## that actually took the damage still showed 50/50.

## ISSUE #173: a floating damage/heal label over the Pokemon it belongs to.
##
## The labels used to be spawned at a hardcoded x (1030 / 530) and y=300 — the two
## ACTIVE slots — so a bench Pokemon's damage was announced over the active's
## head. get_pokemon_screen_location() already knows where every Pokemon in play
## is drawn; this centres the label on that rect and falls back to the old fixed
## spot only when the Pokemon is not on the board at all.
## ISSUE #279: HOW FAR OUTWARD THE FIGURE SITS FROM THE CARD'S CENTRE.
##
## Centred on the card, a damage figure lands squarely on the Pokemon's art. The
## HP readout and the damage counters both live on the side of the card AWAY from
## the centre line (yours to the left, theirs to the right - see _place_duel_row),
## so pushing the label the same way lines it up with the number it is changing
## and clears the art at the same time. TWEAKABLE.

## spawned bottom-right and drifted up - two opposite gestures for the two halves
## of one event, and neither was anywhere near the player's own corner after the
## overhaul moved the piles and prizes. They now both rise out of the gap just
## above the "You" caption in the bottom-right rail, which is the label that names
## whose turn it is about to be.
##
## Derived, not hardcoded: the caption itself is drawn at (RIGHT_RAIL_X,
## PILE_BOT_Y - 26) by _place_rails, so if the rail or the footer moves the labels
## follow. show_floating_label centres its text in a 300px box, hence the -150.

## stepped along the bench row by that wrong width too, so every bench slot past
## the first was reported further right than it is. Everything that aims an
## animation reads this, which is why cards "jump and appear in the new location
## when the card didn't move there to the right spot" (#241), why a Wail switch
## did not look like a retreat (#242), and why a card attached to a bench Pokemon
## flew to the wrong place (#236). It reports the sizes the board actually draws
## now, and the bench y accounts for the slot centring the card inside BENCH_ROW_H.

## ISSUE #282: WHERE A DRAWN CARD ACTUALLY LANDS IN THE HAND.
##
## A draw flew to `player_hand_container` with no override, so it aimed at the
## CENTRE of the hand box and the card then popped to the end of the row when the
## board refreshed. The hand is a centred HBoxContainer, so the landing slot is
## not something that can be calculated - it depends on how many cards are in the
## hand and how tightly they are overlapping. So build the new hand first, let the
## container sort itself, and read the last slot's real rect off the screen.
##
## The new card is made TRANSPARENT rather than hidden, unlike the Active energy
## and tool stacks: hiding a child of a centred HBox drops it out of the layout
## and re-centres every other card in the hand, which would make the whole row
## shuffle sideways for the length of the flight. Alpha keeps the geometry.
## The caller's normal refresh puts the alpha back.
##
## Assumes the card is ALREADY appended to the hand array (so it is the last one).
